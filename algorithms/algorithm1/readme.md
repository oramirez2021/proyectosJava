Given two strings pattern and s. The first string pattern contains only the symbols 0 and 1, and the second string s contains only lowercase English letters.

Let's say that pattern matches a substring s[l..r] of s if the following 3 conditions are met:

    they have equal length;
    for each 0 in pattern the corresponding letter in the substring is a vowel;
    for each 1 in pattern the corresponding letter is a consonant. the task is to calculate the number of substrings of s that match pattern.

Note: In this we define the vowels as a,e,i,o,u, and y. All other letters are consonants.
